# MKZs deep learning project
  
  

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

  This project is an implementation of our semester assignment for "Deep Learning in Practice with Python and LUA" which is a course at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The aim of  project is to create a well designed and sofisticated deep learning model which is capable of classifying news articles based on their titles and descriptions. In the initial implementation our plan is to train the model to be able to recognise the 5 most popular categories, in later implementation we plan to widen the spectrum of categories as well as the precision of our model.

### Built With
*  [Python](https://www.python.org/)
*  [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
*  [skicit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started



  

### Prerequisites

  

In order to be able to run all scripts, the following packages will be needed.

Python 3.8.* which can easily be installed by installing [Anaconda studio](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) which will install the most common libraries for python and jupyter notebook as well.

Besides that users must install TensorFlow and scikit-learn:

```
$ pip install tensorflow
```
```
$ pip install -U scikit-learn
```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Recent technological advancements have changed significantly the way news is produced, consumed, and disseminated. Frequent and on-spot news reporting has been enabled, which smartphones can access anywhere and anytime. News categorization or classification can significantly help in its proper and timely dissemination.

TBD

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_
